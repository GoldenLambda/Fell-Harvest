The god of art, madness, and the color yellow. Hastur is an old god who resides in the city of [[Carcosa]], and seeks to subsume the will of entire worlds. He is worshipped by the [[Cult of the Sign]], a sect of yellow-robed ascetics whose aim it is to infiltrate societies and spread their king's influence, carried by interplanar ships such as [[The Harvester]].

Hastur's influence is most often recognizable by [[The Yellow Sign]] - a mysterious symbol in an unknown language - and the light of the [[Carcosa|Xanthous Sun]] - a sickly yellow glow that renders those exposed more ephemeral and painful to perceive. Hastoric cultists, especially those of high rank, will immerse themselves in this light and etch the sign on their body to receive powerful boons from their master, at the cost of their own autonomy and sanity.

Shortly before the events of this adventure, Hastur and his cult have set their sights on three new worlds to annex into Carcosa: [[Nula]], [[Yearn]], and [[Accorda]].
